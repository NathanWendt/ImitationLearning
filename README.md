# ImitationLearning
Algorithms and implementation for basic imitation learning as well as an implementation of the DAgger algorithm for structured sequence classification. Two data sets are provided: Net talk voice recognition (labels [0-5]) and OCR handwriting (labels[a-z]). Each uses binary features to represent individual characters.
